set is a container that contain uniqe letter or number etc and it doesnt reapet any

numbers or charchters and it sorting it from small to big but it has important syntax

that you have to know like :

how to definition it : set< "data type"> "name of the set";

how to insert it : st.insert("the number or letter that you want to add");

how to use it in for loop : for(auto i = st.begin(); i != st.end(); i++){
        			cout << *i << ' ';
    			    }

set is the solution for some questions and it saves the time of the code and you can 

make it int or ll or char like the simple variable .
